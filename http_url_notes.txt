This is my class that demonstrates HTTP URL connection.
The class works with the following steps

1. Create new URL
2. Open connection, cast connection to HttpURLConnection
3. Set request method to GET
4. Set read timeout to 15 seconds, open connection
5. Read data using InputStreamReader and BufferedReader
6. Read output from URL, add to StringBuilder, convert StringBuilder to a String when method returns.
